# test-bruteforcer
Simple bruteforcer tries

So, basic idea is to get usrlist and passlist and make attempts to log to admin page
Making requests and waiting for 200 (or 302 in some cases) http response
To have tries in output and logging successful tries in 'fort' list

for now - it doesn't work, it is obvious even to me
the problem is - this is the second time I write on python and know like NOTHING about it (except retarded indentation #HATE)
if you have any proposals - will be glad to hear you
